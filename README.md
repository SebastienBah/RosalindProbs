# Rosalind Problems Repo
This is just a little repo where I save the problems from [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/) that I have solved
as well as their solution.

Each folder is a problem and contains a few files:
- README.md; which contains the general requirement of the program
- rosalind_*; which contains the specific input for the program
- *.py; which is the code that solves it
